                       <ul>
                           <li>Gil Scott Heron, born on April 1949, is considered as one of the Fathers of modern Hip Hop and Rap music.</li>
                           <li>He started his career in the '60s and '70s as a Spoken Word artist, basically reciting poetry on an instrumental base.</li>
                           <li>His song "The Revolution will not be televised", apart from being still as popular as it was back then, it is considered as a classic in Hip Hop culture.</li>
                           <li>This paved the way for Hip Hop culture and Rap music to arise more and more later on.</li>
                           <li>"The Bottle", song released in 1973, is among his most famous tracks</li>
                           <li>He dies at the age of 62 in New York in 2011.</li>
